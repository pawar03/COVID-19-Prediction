# COVID-19-Prediction
Covid-19 prediction with B-cell and SARS data



## Predict the epitope region of SARS-CoV2 by analyzing SARS-CoV and B-cell dataset.<br>
*Assumtion*: There is a similarity between sequence of SARS-CoV and that of SARS-CoV2.

### Task Details
Classifying peptides into two categories: 
* antibodies with inducing properties (positive)
* antibodies without inducing properties (negative)

Develop a model to predict the antibody valence of the SARS-CoV2 data. 

*Challenge point*: It does not have a target value.

### Evaluation
* Prediction results for SARS-CoV-2 dataset
 * List of epitope predictions for SARS-CoV-2 using the B-cell and SARS datasets as the training set and the SARS-CoV-2 dataset as the test set.
